## About me:
### I am currently working as a primary school teacher. I like to receive knowledge from different areas of our life. And I got interested in programming. Last year I took the Stage # 0 and Stage # 1 course at rsschool but didn't make it to the end. This year I decided to start again, because for a whole year I was returning to what I want to continue to study but lack discipline.
